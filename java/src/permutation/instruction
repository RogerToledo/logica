You need to count the numbers that can be created by rearranging the digits of a positive integer N
(0 < N < 1000000000 and it has no leading zeros).

Example: there are 6 numbers that can be created by rearranging the digits of 432 and there are 4
numbers that can be formed from the number 120 (you must disconsider numbers with leading
zeros).
